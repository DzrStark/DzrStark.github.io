# About Me

Here is **Zirong Ding (DzrStark, ‰∏ÅÊ¢ìÈïï)**.<br>

I‚Äôm an undergraduate student majoring in Information Engineering  at the School of Telecommunications Engineering, **Xidian University (XDU)**. I‚Äôm expected to graduate in June 2026.

Starting in September 2026, I‚Äôll be pursuing my **Ph.D.** at the Future Media Lab, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS), **Tsinghua University (THU)** üéì.

My research interests revolve around Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for Robotics ü§ñ. I‚Äôm passionate about exploring how multimodal intelligence can bridge the gap between perception, understanding, and action.
